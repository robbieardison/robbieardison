### Hi there!

I'm Robby from Indonesia, currently studying Data Analytics through the IBM Data Analytics Certification course. I'm also a PRO Skill Path member of Codecademy.com which gives me access to all the courses on the website. I'm interested in data science and machine learning, I enjoy toying with numbers and data in general. If you are interested to collaborate, hit me up on my email ardisonouus@hotmail.com
